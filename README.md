# SolarSystemScale

My son's class came up with the idea of putting up a scaled version of our solar system on their ceiling. This exercise is then used to learn about scale.

I created this simple site to demonstrate how to calculate the actual classroom ceiling distances in meters, given the actual planets' distances from our Sun in astronomical units.
